A portfolio in is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities etc.
Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio (asset distribution), out of the set of all portfolios being considered. 

The same logic is being implemented by using python libraries (such as PyPortfolioOpt library).
